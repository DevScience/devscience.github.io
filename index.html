<p><strong>Fundamentals of Computing</strong></p>

<p>Our curriculum is adapted from Stanford University's famous CS101 course, introduction to computing principles. Through the course, students will learn the basics of programming (variables, loops, if logic, etc.) through JavaScript as well as fundamental concepts in hardware and computer networking. By the end of the session, students will be prepared to tackle any programming language, as well as explore more advanced concepts in computing.</p>
