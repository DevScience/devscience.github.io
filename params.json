All profits that we earn are donated back to the Fremont Unified School District, for the benefit of your students. Led by students, for students. \r\n\r\n## Our Founders\r\n\r\nKevin Wu\r\n\r\nI love entrepreneurship, and finding new applications for software and technology. Fluent in HTML, Java, and Bash. \r\n\r\nBrian Tseng\r\n\r\nI'm experienced in both Java and Python, and have used C/C++ in the past. I've tutored in STEM for several years.\r\n\r\nAndrew Kan\r\n\r\nI enjoy coding, and am fluent in Java and C++. I taught Java last year.\r\n\r\nKanav Kalucha\r\n\r\nI am fluent in Java and C++ and love exploring the various applications of computer science. I've taught Java before and look forward to working with you.\r\n\r\n## Our Course\r\n\r\n**Introduction to Java: Object-Oriented Programming**\r\n\r\nJava is a universally recognized programming language used by millions of developers and companies across the globe. Java is a beautiful language suited for beginning programmers, allowing them to grasp the fundamentals of computer science easily. Throughout the 8 class session, students will be taught the basics of programming (variables, functions, loops, objects, etc.), and have the opportunity to create basic programs, apps, and games of their own. By the end of the session, students will be ready to tackle more advanced concepts in Java, and begin exploring the many depths of computing. \r\n\r\n## Scheduling and Tuition\r\n\r\nEach section is 8 classes. Note that instructors may alter a class date/time within certain weeks if personal conflicts arise.\r\n\r\n**Section A:** August 2nd to August 25th\r\n\r\nTuesday, Thursday at 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM\r\n\r\nInstructor: Kanav Kalucha\r\n\r\n**Section B:** August 3rd to August 26th\r\n\r\nWednesday, Friday at 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM\r\n\r\nInstructor: Andrew Kan\r\n\r\n**Section C:** July 30th to August 21st\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, Sunday morning at 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM \r\n\r\nInstructor: Brian Tseng\r\n\r\nEvery section (8 classes each) will be $320, a nonrefundable tuition payable in check addressed to the Fremont Unified School District.
