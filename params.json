Through the course, students will learn the basics of programming (variables, loops, if logic, etc.) through JavaScript as well as fundamental concepts in hardware and computer networking. By the end of the session, students will be prepared to tackle any programming language, as well as explore more advanced concepts in computing.\r\n\r\n## Scheduling and Tuition\r\n\r\nEach section is 8 classes. Note that instructors may alter a class date/time within certain weeks if personal conflicts arise.\r\n\r\n**Section A:** August 2nd to August 25th\r\n\r\nTuesday, Thursday at 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM\r\n\r\nInstructor: Kanav Kalucha\r\n\r\nEmail: seankeller@gmail.com\r\n\r\n**Section B:** August 3rd to August 26th\r\n\r\nWednesday, Friday at 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM\r\n\r\nInstructor: Andrew Kan\r\n\r\nEmail: \r\n\r\n**Section C:** July 30th to August 21st\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, Sunday morning at 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM \r\n\r\nInstructor: Brian Tseng\r\n\r\nEmail:\r\n\r\nEvery section (8 classes each) will be $320, a nonrefundable tuition payable in check addressed to the Fremont Unified School District.
