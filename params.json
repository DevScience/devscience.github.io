Java is a beautiful language suited for beginning programmers, allowing them to grasp the fundamentals of computer science easily. Throughout the 8 class session, students will be taught the basics of programming (variables, functions, loops, objects, etc.), and have the opportunity to create basic programs, apps, and games of their own. By the end of the session, students will be ready to tackle more advanced concepts in Java, and begin exploring the many depths of the computer science world. \r\n\r\n## Scheduling and Tuition\r\n\r\nAll sessions will be $320, a nonrefundable tuition payable in either check addressed to Fremont Unified School District, or by cash in envelope. \r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nPlease email devscience@gmail.com with any questions, comments, or concerns. We look forward to hearing from you!",
